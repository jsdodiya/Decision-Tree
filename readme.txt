# Decision Tree Implementation

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the implementation and visualization of a decision tree for classification tasks. The notebook is structured to provide an intuitive understanding of decision trees while showcasing practical implementation using Python libraries.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare data for training the decision tree model.
- **Model Training**: Build a decision tree classifier using popular Python libraries.
- **Visualization**: Generate and interpret visual representations of the decision tree.
- **Evaluation**: Assess model performance with metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
